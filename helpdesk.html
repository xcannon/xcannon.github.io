<p>When I made this site I could download a song by clicking the link; then one day I did that & a
 player opened up instead&mdash;it turned out to be Adobe Flash, which had installed itself
 as the browser&rsquo;s player without my knowledge, let alone consent.</p>
<p>Anyway, the way around this situation is to right-click (on a Mac Ctrl+click) on the link, then
 from the little menu select &ldquo;Save Link [As]...&rdquo;, & that should bring up the save box.</p>
<p>Clicking&mdash;touching&mdash;the link on my mobile phone starts a download; if necessary,
 the way to right-click is a 2-finger touch (which brings up Save Link),
 again on my Android machine.&nbsp; I think i-phones
 are like that; if you have something else, you probably know how to work it, &
 if you have a Nokia ... you have also my sympathy.</p>
<a name="play"><h2>Player:</h2></a>
<p>The Yahoo player seems to work well enough, as long as you&rsquo;ve got bandwidth
 (even on wifi); just click its play button to hear the whole
 album, or select any individual piece from the buttons on the page, or from the player&rsquo;s
 playlist.&nbsp; It tends to skip any tune that doesn&rsquo;t load right away, though, so
 you&rsquo;ll have to use the button next to the link to maintain continuity if that
 happens.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve gone to a lot of trouble to ensure the integrity of the links,
 so it&rsquo;s not me&mdash;at least not anymore.</p>
<p>It has so far passed testing on Firefox, Chrome & Safari, along w/ the generic Web2Go phone browser.&nbsp; I will never bother to test it on IE, because Microsnot&rsquo;s lame-o excuse for a browser is <span class="ital">still</span> a buggy & insecure piece of shit & everybody should stop using it.</p>
<p>I chose to use this player because it plays whole albums, in order, just by reading the page code &
 noticing links to mp3s ... pretty cool.&nbsp; But it has the same problems as any streaming
 application: bandwidth irregularities will cause stuttering or stalling, & often enough
 choke-ups occur from basically nothing.&nbsp; So if you want to hear these things more&rsquo;n once,
 you should download &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>There are plugins, add-ons &c. that will prevent the player from appearing.&nbsp; One I had
 was AdBlock; you have to tell it to allow scripts from this domain (xcannon.5gbfree.com).&nbsp; If
 that isn&rsquo;t an option, you may have to disable whatever cranklet is causing the problem&mdash;at
 least temporarily&mdash;that is, if you want to hear something before downloading it.</p>
<p>There was, in fact, quite a bit of drama&mdash;even trauma&mdash;involved with the use of
 <a href="ywebplayer.html">Yahoo WebPlayer</a> in 2013; I damn near had a coronary event myself
 until I discovered how to get around the problem.</p>
<a name="other"><h2>Other Issues:</h2></a>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to design relatively simple pages that display well on all devices; but I really
 can&rsquo;t be troubled to check which kind of device is being used, & make adjustments for each of
 them.&nbsp; I mean, it&rsquo;d be a fun project, & if I ever undertake it, you&rsquo;ll see the
 results here.&nbsp; But for now, wider screens are going to have wide paragraphs, & little ones,
 like your phone, are going to have narrow paragraphs.&nbsp; As much as I&rsquo;d love to pretend
 I meant it, it&rsquo;s really just an unfixed issue, which may or may not get fixed.&nbsp; I care
 much, <span class="ital">much</span> more about the way this site sounds than how it looks.</p>
