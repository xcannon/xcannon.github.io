<p>Jan Dussek was around in Mozart&rsquo;s time & was, it is said, the first important
 Bohemian composer for piano.&nbsp; Like many of the musicians of that era, he traveled
 all over Europe performing, & was a teacher as well.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia: &ldquo;Harold Schonberg wrote that he was the first pianist to sit at the piano with his profile to the audience, earning him the appellation &lsquo;le beau
 visage&rsquo;.&nbsp; All subsequent pianists have sat on stage in this manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also had a musical wife, Sophia, & daughter, Olivia, both of whom played & composed for the harp.</p>
<p>From him I have six sonatinas (little sonatas) & six big ones.&nbsp; I
 have also included compositions by the Dussek ladies, mainly a few of Sophia&rsquo;s harp sonatas.</p>
