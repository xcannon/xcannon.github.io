<p>Though it was initially regarded as highly &ldquo;disreputable&rdquo;&mdash;its first appearances in urban
 settings being in saloons, casinos & brothels&mdash;ragtime gradually came to enjoy enormous popularity
 in the early 20th century.&nbsp; For a variety of reasons it has since become pretty thoroughly declass&eacute;, & that&rsquo;s a real shame.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s some of the most charming piano music I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&nbsp; Some of the titles are very much &ldquo;of their own time&rdquo;,
 but they&rsquo;re just handles; most of the titles don&rsquo;t relate much to the music anyway.</p>
<p>The picture at left is undisputed king of ragtime Scott Joplin c. 1904, whose exhortation to pianists to take it easy with the tempo is seen at right.&nbsp; Most composers had similar designations:
 Moderato; Not Too Fast; Don&rsquo;t Fake; & Tempo di Rag.</p>
<p>And yes, I got quite carried away: there are 83 pieces here, including marches, two-steps, ticklers, slow drags, cake walks & even a waltz or 2.&nbsp; I got so immersed in the rag sound I ended up writing one (not included here).</p>
