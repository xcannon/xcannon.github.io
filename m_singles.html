<h1>Wolfgang A. Mozart</h1>
<h3>Singles</h3><hr>
<p>Here are some of Wolfgang&rsquo;s works that I found as separate pieces, though some are
 actual stand-alones & others are not. &nbsp;The first one is, the third isn&rsquo;t
 (it&rsquo;s a truncated version of part 2 of Piano Concerto No. 20).
 &nbsp;The second one, Andante in F, is subheaded as being
 &ldquo;composed for the mechanical organ&rdquo; ... did they have pizza parlors back then?
 &nbsp;Anyway, the organ version is presented here. &nbsp;Rondo in D is the only classical
 piece on this site that I overtly imposed my own will on, in this case by ignoring the
 front & back repeats.
 &nbsp;(It&rsquo;s good, but not 9 minutes worth of good.) &nbsp;The Suite in C is unfinished:
 Mozart was inspired by a large collection of Bach works appearing in Vienna, but evidently lost
 interest after completing 3 parts (a proper suite would have had&mdash;probably&mdash;4 more parts).
 &nbsp;Sophie & Konstanze, like Allegretto in A on another page, was incomplete at his death
 & given a wrap-up by someone else, I know not whom. &nbsp;The title is due to WM writing the names
 of his daughter & wife in the margin above 6 slow, plaintive notes in the short minor-key section
 ... as if he wanted so sing their names there.</p>
