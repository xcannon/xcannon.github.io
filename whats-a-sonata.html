<h1>What&rsquo;s a Sonata?</h1>
<br><hr><div class="fatmarg"><br>

<p>The word &ldquo;sonata&rdquo; essentially means &ldquo;sound piece&rdquo; &
 originally referred to anything that was not sung. &nbsp;Later it came to mean a piece,
 or group of them, played on a single instrument (e.g. keyboard) or a solo instrument (e.g. violin)
 with accompaniment. &nbsp;<!--[With me so far?] &nbsp;-->Scarlatti wrote his
 500 or so sonatas as exercises; they are nonetheless very original & quite
 different from the usual baroque era fare.</p>
<p>All this&mdash;apparently&mdash;is entirely apart from what is known as &ldquo;sonata form&rdquo;,
 which was widely employed in many types of composition: solo, chamber, or orchestral. &nbsp;Sonata
 form was a very old, hoary & venerable musical packaging schema, & composers were slow to
 abandon it. &nbsp; At its most basic, it is this:</p>
<p><span class="em"><span class="ital">A</span><br>repeat <span class="ital">A</span><br>
 <span class="ital">B</span><br>repeat <span class="ital">B</span></span><br>(rarely) Coda</p>
<p>In a major key <span class="ital">A</span> almost always modulates to the dominant, or
 Vth: <span class="ital">B</span> then starts from there (usually) & roams back to the home
 key. &nbsp;<span class="ital">A</span> comprises up to 1/2 of the piece
 & <span class="ital">B</span> is the rest. &nbsp;<span class="ital">B</span> is often
 longer, because it has a development section exploring
 the <span class="ital">A</span> themes in new ways, &/or introducing new material, before
 recapitulating the opening themes. &nbsp;In a minor key, a handful of different modulation patterns
 are available.</p>
<p>As time passed, it became more & more common to forgo repetition of the
 <span class="ital">B</span> section.</p>
<p><span class="ital">In fine</span>, a sonata is a solo-type work with 1 or 2 instruments; sonata form
 is a style of presentation. &nbsp;Many sections of the sonatas on this site are in sonata form, though
 not all; the form itself is used in all kinds of classical music, including some, such as symphonies,
 that may have no solo passages.</p>
