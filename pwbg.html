mind-numbing details

<p><span class="em">More variations on M&uuml;ller</span> &ndash; The theme & 1st 3 variations comprise <span class="ital">Allegretto con variazioni</span> by one August Eberhard M&uuml;ller, a canon of beginner piano.&nbsp; The repeats of his 2nd motives are my addition, not in the original; thus his contribution amounts to around 3:20 of this version.&nbsp; My original variations begin with the 4th one in the minor, & continue through the end.</p>
<p>(It may be noticed, here & elsewhere, that I don&rsquo;t include the customary pauses between variations.&nbsp; In fact I dislike them, & much prefer a continuous, unbroken rhythm.)</p>
<p>But why write variations on someone else&rsquo;s elementary work at all?&nbsp; Did it seem unfinished, somehow?&nbsp; Yes, to the 2nd question: the way it ends is a bit clowny & seemed to cry out for follow-up.&nbsp; On good days, once started I don&rsquo;t stop until it&rsquo;s over; that day was a good one.</p>
