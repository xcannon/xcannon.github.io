<h2>&ldquo;People Say Some Stupid Stuff.&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>&ndash; George Wallace</h3>
<h4>(the comedian, not that other guy)</h4>
<hr><br>
</div>
<p>Mr. Wallace has given us numerous vignettes supporting the truth of his statement,
 but we are unlikely ever to run out of examples.&nbsp; Here are some more:</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>D&eacute;j&agrave; vu times two</h4>
Of this very basic screw-up I have seen more instances by scientific writers than I&rsquo;d
 like (aren&rsquo;t they supposed to be smarter?): It isn&rsquo;t d&eacute;j&agrave; vu
 if it <span class="ital">actually happened before</span>.&nbsp; D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, as
 <span class="ital">everyone</span> knows, is the weird feeling of thinking that you have
 experienced what you are going through before, & then realizing you
 <span class="ital">really never have</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
 when we utter the classic phrase, &ldquo;Whoa, d&eacute;j&agrave;
 vu!&rdquo;&nbsp; But if something similar actually <span class="ital">did</span> happen,
 that&rsquo;s just called <span class="ital">remembering</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
 not <span class="ital">day-jah-voo</span>, which is your memory playing tricks&mdash;it&rsquo;s
 your memory actually doing its regular job.&nbsp; So when the science author screws it up, I
 <span class="ital">don&rsquo;t</span> get d&eacute;j&agrave; vu because, unfortunately,
 I&rsquo;ve seen it before.<p>[The confusion has been exploited humorously to good
 effect.&nbsp; A pair of examples are a Far Side cartoon (guy opens front door
 to freaky clown apparition, utters classic phrase), & a vintage Yogi
 Berra line: &ldquo;It was d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again.&rdquo;]</li>
<li><h4>Carrot <span class="ital">on</span> a stick</h4>Just about everybody these days uses
 the carrot & stick idea like so: Offer &rsquo;em a carrot, & if that ain&rsquo;t workin&rsquo;
 hit &rsquo;em with a stick.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just a reward / punishment scenario, for which there
 must be a dozen far better metaphors.&nbsp; The original meaning is this: You&rsquo;re riding
 a mule, & it refuses to go.&nbsp; So you tie a carrot to a stick, with a piece of string,
 & using the stick like a fishing pole, you hang the carrot out in front of the mule&rsquo;s face.
&nbsp; The mule is suddenly motivated to grab the carrot, moves forward, & keeps going
 after it all the way home.&nbsp; (If you want this ruse to keep working, you&rsquo;d better give
 &rsquo;em the carrot then.)&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pretty devious trick, but people use it on each other
 all the time&mdash;it should be called carrot & string, as in stringing
 someone along.&nbsp; The stick, in any case, is a passive agent
 in the story; no whacking the mule, which probably wouldn&rsquo;t work anyway.&nbsp; Again,
 it&rsquo;s people who ought to know better&mdash;in
 this case political writers&mdash;who are the most frequent offenders.</li>
 <li><h4>A Rule of Thumb</h4>&ldquo;Speakin&rsquo; o&rsquo; whackin&rsquo; people w/ sticks . . .
 In England, long, long ago, it was a societal norm, not addressed by any law, that it was OK
 to beat one&rsquo;s wife with a stick, so long as one used a stick no thicker than one&rsquo;s
 thumb.&rdquo;<p>
The reason the above is in quotes is that it&rsquo;s from this page&rsquo;s past.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
 false.&nbsp; I had the tale from multiple sources, but I finally bothered to investigate
 more fully, & it comes from an old-time slur on an English judge, which like any urban legend,
 spread by acceptance & repetition.&nbsp; The only part I got right in the old entry
 was when I said, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t Internet bullshit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
 take my word for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both those things are right, but in this case 2 rights still
 make a wrong.&nbsp; The expression &ldquo;rule of thumb&rdquo; apparently meant measuring
 with your thumb, instead of, like, a ruler; looser, less strict.&nbsp; That makes
 sense.&nbsp; Sorry for perpetuating a lie; it happens.<p>I&rsquo;ll leave this entry as a cautionary
 tale: Don&rsquo;t believe everything you read, especially if it was written by a lawyer.</li>
<li><h4>Also sprach Zpatula</h4>The rubber thingy used to scrape cake batter out of a bowl:
 that&rsquo;s a spatula.&nbsp; The flat metal thing used to flip burgers on a grill:
 that&rsquo;s a flipper.&nbsp; How the normal, everyday word <span class="ital">flipper</span> got replaced
 by the obscure Latin word <span class="ital">spatula</span> as the preferred term for the thing
 guys use to flip meat patties is beyond my ability to comprehend.<p>Similar, but
 even more obscure: the minute & a half anthem that opens up the movie
 <span class="ital">2001: A Space Odyssey</span> is called &ldquo;Sunrise&rdquo;;
 it&rsquo;s part 1 of 9 in a half-hour opus called <span class="ital">Also Sprach
 Zarathustra</span>.&nbsp; But for some goddam reason, everybody calls the tune,
 &ldquo;Sunrise&rdquo;, by the name of the entire work.&nbsp; Again, the question is:
 why, if you can just say &ldquo;Sunrise&rdquo; & be right, would anyone want to
 bother uttering or writing the phrase &ldquo;Also sprach motherfuckin&rsquo;
 Zarathustra&rdquo;? <span class="ital">Why?</span></li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;I could care less.&rdquo;</h4>Not me.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;So what else is new?&rdquo;</h4>Well, it&rsquo;s not that new, but certain simple folk
 have&mdash;literally thoughtlessly&mdash; burdened the saying &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s new?&rdquo;
 with an extra word that is not merely superfluous, but detrimental to its meaning.&nbsp; The original
 was at least marginally whimsical, whereas the &ldquo;new&rdquo; version is nothing short of
 tedious.&nbsp; So what&rsquo;s new?</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;Evolution is just a theory.&rdquo;</h4>Sometimes smart people carelessly
 repeat idiotic things that have somehow become &ldquo;common knowledge&rdquo;.&nbsp; But it takes
 a genuine blockhead to promote this heinous lie&mdash;a deliberate lie fabricated
 in a lie factory & calculated to achieve a specific effect.&nbsp; It parses as follows:
 The perpetrators knew full well
 that when they said &ldquo;evolution&rdquo;, they were actually referring to Natural Selection, the
 mechanism proposed by Darwin & Wallace to <span class="ital">explain</span>
 evolution.&nbsp; Evolution itself, as the professional prevaricators also knew, was an accepted
 fact in natural science (as biology was formerly called) before Charles Darwin was even
 born.&nbsp; Having confounded fact & theory, these cynical liars then confused scientific
 theory&mdash;we all know what that is, right?&mdash; & &ldquo;street&rdquo; theory, i.e.
 &ldquo;just&rdquo; an idea someone has.&nbsp; As an icing of deceit it is subtly implied, by the
 word <span class="ital">a</span>, that
 &ldquo;Evolution&rdquo; currently is one of many competing
 notions scientists have about life.&nbsp; This was essentially true of Darwin&rsquo;s theory when
 he published <span class="ital">The Origin of Species</span> a
 <span class="ital">century & a half</span> ago.&nbsp; Today
 it is utterly false: numerous sciences other than biology confirm the theory
 of Natural Selection, virtually all scientists accept it, & it has no viable competition.&nbsp; I
 have no idea what fundamentalist PR lab managed to construct such a compact little grenade of
 a phrase, but they surely
 were not paid enough: it does a lot of dirty work in a short space.&nbsp; Religious fanatics,
 in the interest of education prevention, are still getting serious mileage from this insidious
 falsehood.&nbsp; <span class="ital">Oy.</span><p>Corrected, the statement would be:
 Natural Selection is definitely the theory [that explicates the occurrence of
 evolution].<p>Here&rsquo;s da facts: Saying you don&rsquo;t
 &ldquo;believe&rdquo; in evolution is <span class="ital">exactly</span> the same thing as
 saying you don&rsquo;t &ldquo;believe&rdquo; in erosion.&nbsp; Belief has no bearing on the matter, & these
 processes&mdash;along with many others&mdash;continue working change over time on this Earth,
 whether anyone understands or even knows about them.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;Real men&rdquo; don&rsquo;t eat quiche</h4>So those who have eaten it are
 what, <span class="ital">fake</span> men?&nbsp; Fuck <span class="ital">you</span>,
 Hoss.&nbsp; Whatever retard thought of this presumably wouldn&rsquo;t object to
 scrambled egg pie if it didn&rsquo;t have a French name.&nbsp; (I will <span class="ital">never</span>
 understand the antipathy of some of the more ignorant kindreds of our loose-knit society toward
 France: we could&rsquo;ve lost the Revolution without them, & they gave us a magnificent
 statue, our world-famous emblem of liberty, <span class="ital">for nothing!</span>)&nbsp; Here is
 a very un-p.c. response to this brainless drivel&mdash;which seems to resurface with every recurrence
 of cowboy clothing fads&mdash;that I came up with decades ago: What do the English put in their
 pies?&nbsp; Meat.&nbsp; What do the French put in their pies?&nbsp; Eggs.&nbsp; What do
 Americans put in their pies?&nbsp; <span class="ital">Ffruuu-ueit.</span>&nbsp; So maybe
 some Americans oughtta shut up about who eats what kinda pie.<p>Y&rsquo;know what real men
 don&rsquo;t do?&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t kiss their own arms.&nbsp; That shit is weird &
 disturbing.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;People who live in glass houses shouldn&rsquo;t throw stones.&rdquo;</h4>
Yes.&nbsp; Also people who live in grass houses shouldn&rsquo;t light fires, & people who live
 in sugar-cube houses shouldn&rsquo;t throw water.&nbsp; So
 what?&nbsp; What have we learned here?&nbsp; How about: People who formulate aphorisms from
 invented situations should only be given blunt-tipped scissors.</li>
<li><h4>A deathly fear of the <span class="ital">same people</span></h4>
These li&rsquo;l diatribes are mostly about language, as is this one,
 & that&rsquo;s <span class="ital">all</span> it&rsquo;s
 about.<!--&nbsp; (U wanna write hate mail, write it to urself, hater.)-->
<p>It&rsquo;s a right bizarre coincidence that both Greek & Latin have the word
 <span class="ital">homo</span>, each with an entirely different meaning: in Greek it means
 <span class="ital">same</span> & in Latin <span class="ital">human</span>.&nbsp; Therefore,
 technically, the ill-considered epithet <span class="ital">homophobe</span> means
 someone who has either a fear of people or a fear of sameness&mdash;both possible fears, I guess,
 but pretty far off the mark, intent-wise.&nbsp; Plus, as Morgan Freeman has tweeted,
 it isn&rsquo;t about <span class="ital">fear</span> at all;
 it&rsquo;s about intolerance.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t have a snappy, one-word replacement; but I have
 to say, if ya keep talking stupid, others will stop listening.</li>
<li><h4>Physics goes nuts</h4>
&ldquo;In an alternate universe, I&rsquo;d be . . . &rdquo; doing, thinking, wearing such &
 so forth.&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; I wrote an entry for this spot
 about alternate realities&mdash;& how unlikely you & I are to show up in any of
 them (assuming they exist)&mdash;but deleted it: there&rsquo;s so much
 more to it that has to be addressed, probably in a full-page jeremiad of its
 own.&nbsp; (Yes, it&rsquo;s worse than I thought.)&nbsp; When [if] I get done
 researching & writing it, I&rsquo;ll put a link to it here.<p>Somewhat Random
 Gripe #1: Hey, scientists & others who write about astronomy: Stop telling me
 what an AU is.&nbsp; I know what an AU is; so stop telling me what an AU is,
 because I already know what a goddam AU is.&nbsp; So stop telling me what it
 is.&nbsp; Nine of ten people reading your book or article know what an AU is;
 the rest can refer to the goddam glossary.</li>
<li><h4>Choose your weapon</h4>
It&rsquo;s better to bring a knife to a gun fight than nothing; it might come in handy,
 you never know.&nbsp; Maybe look around for some rocks, too.<p>SRG #2: Also, stop saying
 &ldquo;wheapon&rdquo;.&nbsp; Not a real word.</li>
<li><h4>His or her or its &ldquo;silence speaks volumes&rdquo;</h4>
Come on.&nbsp; Silence can&rsquo;t even speak a chapter.&nbsp; The most pregnant pause in
 history spoke maybe a couple of sentences.&nbsp; A paragraph, at the outside.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;When all&rsquo;s said & done ...&rdquo;</h4>
... then there&rsquo;s nothing else to say or do, elsewise it would not all have been
 done & said.&nbsp; Why do they always continue talking? . . .&nbsp; When all&rsquo;s
 said & done, I just can&rsquo;t seem to shut up.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s
 all water under the bridge.&nbsp; Bottom line, it all adds up.&nbsp; In the final analysis,
 the chickens come home to roost.&nbsp; Furthermore ...</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;Time spent fishing cannot be deducted from a man&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</h4>
Got news for ya, Cheswick: time spent doing anything is time spent,
 period.&nbsp; Deductions are <span class="ital">au-to-mat-ic</span>.&nbsp; Whether
 working, copulating, programming, sleeping, exercising, fishing, farming, eating
 pizza, listening to music: all the same&nbsp; Amazing, the nonsense people stick
 on their bumpers.&nbsp; Similarly&mdash;</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;He who dies with the most toys wins.&rdquo;</h4>
Wins what?</li>
<li><h4>Noggin over tootsies</h4>
Everyone has noticed this one: Except when using gravity boots, our heads are
 <span class="ital">over</span> our heels practically all the time; it&rsquo;s
 the normal state of affairs.&nbsp; Obviously it should be &ldquo;heels over
 head&rdquo;&mdash;but the only time anyone says that is when they&rsquo;re
 doing the same thing I am right now.&nbsp; So what&rsquo;s new?<p>Speaking
of anatomy: &ldquo;ass-backwards&rdquo; is actually, again, the normal state of
 affairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ass-forwards&rdquo;: now <span class="ital">that</span>
 would be messed up.</li>
<li><h4>Rush Limbaugh</h4><span class="ital">Everything.</span>&nbsp; By which
 I mean, nothing he&rsquo;s ever said isn&rsquo;t stupid.&nbsp; Everything he says
 is nothing, fact-wise, logic-wise, or sense-wise.&nbsp; He is a
 hate-fear-&-hurt-monger, & the fact that he is nonetheless a wealthy individual
 reflects very badly on the citizenry of the USA, where his shit-filled radio show
 is, unbelievably, <span class="ital">still</span> being aired.&nbsp; I guess
 this isn&rsquo;t very humorous ... OK: he&rsquo;s a fat
 bastard!<p>&ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; Laura: the female Rush Limbaugh.&nbsp; A
 horrible person who says terrible things.&nbsp; Both these people have
 mind cancer.<p>The next 2 also aren&rsquo;t sayings, but just fall under the heading
 of Stupid Stuff:</li>
<li><h4>Philosophy</h4>Chewing gum for the mind; don&rsquo;t waste your time.</li>
<li><h4>Religion</h4>Cotton candy for the mind; it&rsquo;s actually
 <span class="ital">bad</span> for you.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.&rdquo;</h4>. . . but
 maybe check whether it&rsquo;s <span class="ital">about</span> to break, & if so
 then <span class="ital">fix it.</span>&nbsp; Similarly, &ldquo;the squeaky wheel
 gets the grease&rdquo; is typically short-sighted: the squeaking is a sure sign
 the wheel is breaking or broken, so if you&rsquo;re doing things right, the
 squeaky wheel gets replaced.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a no-brainer.&rdquo;</h4>I&rsquo;m always leery of
 this one.&nbsp; It could mean something you don&rsquo;t need to think about,
 or it could mean something that&rsquo;s sensible only to a person with no brain.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;I&rsquo; in &lsquo;team&rsquo;.&rdquo;</h4>
But there&rsquo;s an &lsquo;m&rsquo;, & there&rsquo;s an &lsquo;e&rsquo;; so
 there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;me&rsquo; in &lsquo;team&rsquo;.&nbsp; Talk about
 a no-brainer.</li>
<li><h4>Animal misnomers</h4>Prairie dogs aren&rsquo;t dogs.&nbsp;
 Groundhogs aren&rsquo;t hogs.&nbsp;
 Koala bears aren&rsquo;t bears.&nbsp;
 Starfish aren&rsquo;t fish;
 jellyfish aren&rsquo;t fish; shellfish aren&rsquo;t fish (if it has a
 shell&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a fish).&nbsp; Crayfish aren&rsquo;t fish; on the
 other hand, a crawdad <span class="ital">might</span> actually be a dad.</li>
<li><h4>Sarah lied</h4>Goddammit, we were promised Death Panels.&nbsp; Where
 are the Death Panels?!?</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;United States of America&rdquo;</h4>United, my ass.</li>
<li><h4>Nuc-u-lar, Feb-u-ary</h4>
<span class="ital"><span class="em">Nu-cle-ar.&nbsp; Fe-bru-ary.</span></span>&nbsp;
 What the fuck is so hard about that?</li>
<li><h4>Missing needles</h4>Did people in olden times do a lot of outdoor
 sewing?&nbsp; Who ever actually had to look for a needle in a haystack?&nbsp; ... Related:</li>
<li><h4>Decoys aligned</h4>Who ever actually put ducks in a row?&nbsp; How long did they stay there?&nbsp; Not long, I bet ... so why bother?&nbsp; Are they talking about lining up decoys or something?&nbsp; If so, the saying should be &ldquo;getting your fake ducks in a row&rdquo;, to avoid confusion.&nbsp; Right?</li>
<li><h4>The Quilted Resum&eacute;</h4>At employment agencies,
 job-hunting seminars & resum&eacute; workshops they all say the same thing:
 &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a product, you&rsquo;ve got to sell yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
 Well, if I could <span class="ital">sell</span> things,
 <span class="ital">I&rsquo;d be in goddam sales,</span> wouldn&rsquo;t
 I?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the only job that always has, like, a hundred listings,
 any day of the year.&nbsp; If
 I could do that shit, <span class="ital">I&rsquo;d be doing it,</span> instead
 of sitting in a plastic chair listening to
 people say such goddam stupid things.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;What goes around comes around.&rdquo;</h4>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be
 nice if that were true ... but as any fool can plainly see: 99% of the time,
 what goes around goes around.</li>
<li><h4>Danger: butterflies</h4>There is a saying that one flap of a butterfly&rsquo;s
 wing in Brazil can be the start of a hurricane that wreaks havoc in the
 Caribbean ... or some such stuff.&nbsp; If that&rsquo;s how it works, then what
 of the hundreds of jet planes taking off every day?&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t they
 blow everything & everyone clear off the planet & into outer space?</li>
<li><h4>Controlled substances</h4>This is a laff riot: anything that is
 designated a &ldquo;controlled substance&rdquo; is invariably a
 completely out-of-control substance.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;There, but for the grace of god, go I.&rdquo;</h4>This shows
 how little some people think before they talk.&nbsp; The clear implication of this
 is &ldquo;There, <span class="ital">by</span> the &lsquo;grace of god&rsquo;,
 goes <span class="ital">that</span> schmuck.&rdquo;&nbsp; Basically, then,
 it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Better him than me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not so noble-sounding
 now, is it?</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try anything once.&rdquo;</h4>Speaking of &ldquo;better you than me&rdquo;: This shows even better how little some people think before they talk.&nbsp; If I had to make a list of the things I won&rsquo;t try <span class="ital">even once</span>, I wouldn&rsquo;t have time to do anything else.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;Whatever doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger.&rdquo;</h4>
This idea originated with philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (see entry on
 Philosophy, above).&nbsp; There are
 hospitals full of people around the world who disprove his statement without
 saying a word....&nbsp; If that isn&rsquo;t obvious enough, there are
 <span class="ital">lots</span> of things that don&rsquo;t kill you that
 make you weaker; they&rsquo;re called injuries & diseases.&nbsp; Nietzsche
 had one, syphilis, that did in fact kill him ... but before it did,
 did it make him stronger?&nbsp; No, it made him
 <span class="ital">insane</span>.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to outrun the bear, I just have
 to outrun you.&rdquo;</h4>No, my dear friend, I&rsquo;m afraid your
 contest is with the bear ... if you can still hear me.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;Even a broken clock is right twice a day.&rdquo;</h4>And yet,
 remains useless.&nbsp; This is the most <span class="ital">insignificant</span>
 truth I&rsquo;ve ever heard, & I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll help anyone
 move any broken clocks at their next yard sale.</li>
<li><h4>&ldquo;I was <span class="ital">born</span> ready.&rdquo;</h4>Ready for
 what?&nbsp; Human babies are born ready for nothing, except sucking & soiling
 themselves.&nbsp; Sharks: now those babies are born ready.</li>
<li><h4>Quittin&rsquo; time</h4>There are a bunch of adages about not quitting,
 never giving up.&nbsp; But an inability to know when to quit is behind some
 of history&rsquo;s most awful tragedies & piteous failures; blindly forging ahead
 sometimes leads straight to disaster.&nbsp; Yes, perseverence is a fine thing,
 & generally it is good to stick to the plan, go for your dream, &c.&nbsp; But
 periodic evaluations are also necessary, & there are times when giving up
 is absolutely the right thing to do.&nbsp; Like, if you&rsquo;re Kim Jong Un.
 Or Rush Limbaugh.</li>
</ul>
