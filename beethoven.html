<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s father in Bonn, Germany, tried to turn him into another Wolfgang Mozart,
 sometimes dragging the boy out of bed to practice when he came home drunk.&nbsp; However, he
 did not manage to sour young Ludwig on music, & with teaching he became accomplished enough at 16
 to meet Mozart, whom he impressed with his piano improvisations.&nbsp; Despite being a famously
 insensitive person, he composed some of the most sensitive & beautiful music there is.</p>
<p>The piece called Leonore is from a complete score for orchestra that was taken out of circulation
 by the S.L. County library system & somehow ended up in my lap.&nbsp; I tackled it
 a few years ago, & made it sound pretty good ... but I recently went over it again & made it
 even better.&nbsp; It is alone on its own album.</p>
<p>Besides that, here are several of Uncle Ludwig&rsquo;s piano sonatas, for which he is justly
 renowned, as well as 3 sonatinas well known to students.</p>
