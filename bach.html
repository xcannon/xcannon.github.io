<p>Here is a mess o&rsquo; tunes by the god-emperor of music&mdash;the greatest composer of all
 time.</p>
<p>Bach was born the last of 8 children in Eisenach, Thuringia, into a musical family
 of long standing.&nbsp; He became not only a hugely talented keyboardist & composer, but perhaps
 music&rsquo;s first scientist.&nbsp; It was said of him less than 50 years after his death,
 &ldquo;What Newton was as a [natural] philosopher, Bach was as a musician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Toccata & Fugue in D minor is, so far, my masterpiece of MIDI in &rarr; audio out.&nbsp; If
 you explore nothing else I&rsquo;ve done here, at least check out that one.</p>
<p>The decision to &ldquo;play&rdquo; some of these on harpsichord was subjective but not entirely
 arbitrary....&nbsp; It just sounded better in some places; more like it belonged.</p>
