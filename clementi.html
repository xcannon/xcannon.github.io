<p>Muzio Clementi was a contemporary of Mozart, but was lucky enough to live much longer.&nbsp; He was born in Rome and spent most of his career in London.&nbsp; Besides being a prolific composer & popular performer, he was a teacher, publisher and instrument maker.</p>
<p>Apparently when he was in Vienna in 1781 the emperor decided to stage a piano duel, as it were,
 between Clementi & Mozart.&nbsp; They both did so well the contest was declared a draw.</p>
