<p>Here are a couple of books I read & was greatly edified by; everyone
 who reads them will better understand the current state of things in the US & how it
 got that way.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Moral_Politics.html?id=R-4YBCYx6YsC"
 target="_blank">Moral
 Politics</a></h4>How Liberals & Conservatives Think<br>by George Lakoff&nbsp; (1996; 2nd ed. 2002)
<p>Not an easy read, though not the toughest I&rsquo;ve encountered; for one thing,
 you will never again see the words &ldquo;nurturant&rdquo; & &ldquo;nurturance&rdquo;
 this many times&mdash;about 50 each, I&rsquo;d say.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s worth the effort
 to understand the main thesis: that Americans use the metaphor of family to relate to political
 matters&mdash;thus conferring upon them an unwarranted moral component&mdash;& that they have only two models of the family: Strict Father & Nurturant Parent
 (conservative & liberal, respectively).&nbsp; It explains how adherents of one paradigm
 are utterly unable to comprehend the logic or motivations of the other.&nbsp; After a thorough
 exploration of both sides from just about every possible angle, the conclusion is a
 well-reasoned case for the humaneness of Nurturance, & therefore liberalism.</p>
 <p>It&rsquo;s from the &rsquo;90s, so there are references to Pres. Clinton, Newt Gingrich
 & so forth; but if anything it&rsquo;s <span class="ital">more</span> relevant now.&nbsp; Also,
 the approach to the problem is via cognitive science, never applied to this area before.</p>
</li>
<li><h4><a href="http://www.colinwoodard.com/americannations.html" target="_blank">American
 Nations</a></h4>A History
 of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America<br>by Colin Woodard&nbsp; (2011)
<p>A fascinating alternate look at North Americans&rsquo; viewpoints & behaviors based on
 their cultural roots in any of 11 founding groups in the US, Mexico & Canada.&nbsp; Some
 of the &ldquo;tribes&rdquo; are: Yankeedom, New Netherlands, Tidewater, Deep South, El Norte,
 New France, Greater Appalachia, & the Far West.&nbsp; Each has its core beliefs & prejudices,
 based on religious ethics (Puritans & Quakers), commercial concerns (NY), adoption of
 local custom (French Canadian), folkways & feuds from the Old Country (Appalachia),
 & so on. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s hard to believe that so many attitudes & customs from antique
 colonial outposts could have survived into the present time, but that is much of what this
 social & cultural history sets out to demonstrate.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an interesting examination of
 the people of the US & its neighbors&mdash;with their many conflicts&mdash;from an entirely
 new direction.</p>

 <span class="em"><a href="http://www.republicofpirates.net" target="_blank">The Republic of
 Pirates</a></span><br>Being the True and Surprising Story of the Caribbean Pirates and
 the Man Who Brought Them Down&nbsp; (2007)
<p>I never really understood the fascination of the grotty pirate life ... until I
 read this book.</p>
</li>
</ul><br>
This one is a page-flipper if you&rsquo;re of Celtic descent, or are just intrigued by
 &ldquo;lost civilizations&rdquo;.
<ul>
<li><h4><a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-Discovery-of-Middle-Earth/" target="_blank">The
 Discovery of Middle Earth</a></h4>Mapping the Lost World of the Celts<br>by Graham Robb&nbsp; (2013)
<p>Partly by taking bicycle & pedestrian tours of remote areas of France & England, the author
 finds mounting evidence that the Druids of the ancient Celtic culture plotted the placement
 of villages, shrines & such along lines leading to the sun&rsquo;s places on the horizon at
 the solstices, thereby creating the most accurate map of Europe of its time&mdash;not to
 mention its straightest roads.&nbsp; Along the way
 we are treated to tantalizing indications&mdash;via artwork on pots
 & metal vessels, Roman writings, surviving ruins, & other sources&mdash;of what these poorly
 understood people were really like, & what role the Druids played in their world, which once
 stretched from the Near East to the Atlantic.&nbsp; Mesmerizing.</p>

<li><h4><a href="http://literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species/"
 target="_blank">The Origin of Species</a></h4>
<span class="em">by Means of Natural Selection,</span><br>or
 the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life<br>by Charles Darwin&nbsp; (1859)
<p>Another pretty tough read, mostly because it&rsquo;s just really long.&nbsp; It becomes more
 & more obvious as you go along, though, that the people who criticize this book have never read
 it.&nbsp; Without knowing anything about the science of heredity&mdash;let alone DNA&mdash;Darwin
 lays out an airtight case for the reality of the mechanism of Natural Selection as the primary
 means of the diversification of life on Earth.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s almost overkill,
 really (& the author does manage to crack an occasional joke along the way).&nbsp; Also,
 people who say he took all the credit for the idea are full o&rsquo; fertilizer:
 he nearly falls over himself linking ideas to their originators, especially in the
 parallel work of A.R. Wallace, who would have published if Darwin hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I
 always knew the current evidence for the theory is overwhelming; I did <span class="ital">not</span>
 know that it was overwhelming in the first place, over 150 years ago.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry,
 but one has to be some kind of dolt to be disrespectful & disbelieving of Darwin&rsquo;s rather
 obvious conclusions.</p>
<p>Amusingly, Darwin refers to this 500-page work as an <span class="ital">abstract</span>, the
 actual records & tables of data being far too bulky for inclusion.</p>

<a name="new">Here is a pair of books about history&mdash;wait, don&rsquo;t tune out yet; they&rsquo;re really quite fascinating!
<ul>
<li><h4><a href="http://sundown.afro.illinois.edu/liesmyteachertoldme.php" target="_blank">Lies My Teacher Told Me</a></h4>Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong<br>by James W. Loewen&nbsp; (1995; 2nd ed. 2007)
<p>The reason I, you, & everybody else hated American History in high school is that we can tell when we're being lied to.&nbsp; They should call it American Mythology.&nbsp; It was years before I idly grabbed a paperback about the Russian revolution & got hooked: few studies interest me more now&mdash;<span class="ital">any</span> history, including American.&nbsp; This indictment of textbooks (<span class="ital">not</span> teachers) explores the bad & the ugly that is left out of virtually all high-school texts, even now; racism & genocide top the list.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t America-bashing, just telling the whole story: in fact it&rsquo;s a history course in itself.&nbsp; For just one example, Helen Keller is routinely touted as a grand success story, without mentioning what she was successful at.&nbsp; The textbooks sidestep this because she was a committed Socialist her entire adult life, & that was what fired her humanitarianism.&nbsp; For more, hey: read it!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s well worth your time, I promise&mdash;certainly more than the time you spent in class.&nbsp; I am currently [Jan. 2016] reading it <span class="ital">again</span>.</p>

<li><h4><a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/103225/embers-of-war-by-fredrik-logevall/9780375756474/" target="_blank">Embers of War</a></h4>The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America&rsquo;s Vietnam<br>by Fredrik Logevall&nbsp; (2012)
<p>This is the highly absorbing story of France&rsquo;s Vietnam War.&nbsp; It covers WWII to 1959, but begins w/ the poignant tale of Ho Chi Minh&rsquo;s visit to Paris in 1919 to attempt to persuade US President Wilson to acknowledge his country&rsquo;s petition for independence.&nbsp; Though he was undoubtedly a Commie bastard, it&rsquo;s hard not to see his side of things as you peruse this sprawling, epic narrative.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no idle cliché to say I couldn&rsquo;t put it down; I verily found it hard to stop reading.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve often expressed my impression of real history as a series of accidents punctuated by bad decisions; this book does nothing to change it.&nbsp; The author has great talents for storytelling & penetrating analysis, & this won him a Pulitzer.&nbsp; Freakin&rsquo; bra-<span class="ital">vo</span>.</p>

If you&rsquo;re interested in recent financial history&mdash;& who wouldn&rsquo;t be?&mdash;<a href="http://michaellewiswrites.com/" target="_blank">Michael Lewis</a> is the guy to read.&nbsp; He manages to make this muddy subject both clear & interesting.&nbsp; <span class="ital">Liar&rsquo;s Poker, The Big Short,</span> & <span class="ital">Flash Boys</span> all deal w/ Wall St. while <span class="ital">Boomerang</span> is about the echoes of the 2008 crash elsewhere in the world.&nbsp; Lewis is  also the author of <span class="ital">The Blind Side</span> & <span class="ital">Moneyball</span>, so at latest count 3 of his books were made into movies.&nbsp; You will be both educated & entertained.<br>
