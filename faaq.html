<p>As a service to humanity, here&rsquo;s a dose of reason &/or reality:</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>The glass is half empty.</h4>Someone took a drink out of it: how else did it get like
 that? &nbsp;Nobody fills up glasses like that; if you hired someone to fill glasses with water
 & they did that, you&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Hey, what the hell do you think you&rsquo;re
 doing? &nbsp;Fill up the glasses properly or hit the road.&rdquo; &nbsp;Glasses are seldom if ever
 halfway &ldquo;full&rdquo;: somebody took a swig, or some was spilled, or some evaporated. &nbsp;The
 glass is most probably therefore, by definition, half empty. &nbsp;Problem solved. *</li>
<li><h4>Yes, of course the tree makes a sound.</h4>In principle you could leave behind
 a recording device, come back, hit playback, & hear a sound. &nbsp;Ergo a sound was made. &nbsp;Q.E.D.:
 <span class="ital">stop asking this.</span></li>
 <li><h4>The egg&mdash;<span class="ital">obviously</span>&mdash;came first.</h4>Reptiles,
 amphibians, fish, & yes, bugs, produced eggs for hundreds of millions of years in the complete
 absence of birds, poultry, chickens. &nbsp;The egg came way, way, way, way, way, way, way,
 <span class="ital">way</span> first. &nbsp;End of story.</li>
 <li><h4>Something like: wh - wh - wh - wh - wh ...</h4>(My transliteration of the sound
 of one-hand clapping.)</li>
<li><h4>What happens when the irresistible force meets the immovable object?</h4>One
 of them loses. ** &nbsp;Next.</li>
</ul>
