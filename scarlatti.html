<p>Domenico Scarlatti was born in the same year as Handel & Bach, the son of renowned Neapolitan
 opera composer Alessandro Scarlatti.&nbsp; He spent much of his life in Madrid, catering
 to the musical desires of Spanish royalty; the local music influenced his
 work quite a bit.&nbsp; He was an early innovator & prolific composer of
 keyboard <a href="whats-a-sonata.html">sonatas</a>, and wrote half a thousand of them, mostly
 single-movement pieces like these.</p>
<p>The first set came from a book; the next 2 albums were downloaded pretty much at
 random from the entire catalog online.&nbsp; Some are a little better than others, but there
 isn&rsquo;t a bad one in the bunch!&nbsp; Unlike with other sonata composers here,
 the playing order of the songs is my idea & the numbers are strictly unofficial.</p>
