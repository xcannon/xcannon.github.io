<h1>Sonatina Saga</h1>
<br><hr><br>

<p>Muzio Clementi&rsquo;s 6 sonatinas Op. 36 of 1798 were extremely popular in their time, & are
 still a favorite in the student repertoire.&nbsp; On the old Interweb I stumbled across
 the sheet music for what were reputed to be follow-ups&mdash;2 sets of 3 sonatinas billed
 as Op. 37 & 38&mdash;and had finished sequencing them when my suspicions arose again & I
 did some following up of my own; I already knew of a set of 3 &ldquo;big&rdquo; sonatas
 called Op. 37.&nbsp; Turns out someone, back in the 18th century&mdash;probably the original
 publisher&mdash;had repackaged & re-released Clementi&rsquo;s much earlier work (Op. 4) as new
 material, to capitalize on the success of Op. 36.&nbsp; This deception was never fully exposed & has
 apparently survived right down to the present day.</p>
<p>All of which goes to show that the omnipresence of weasels in the music business
 is nothing new.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very nice pieces, though, so here they are; & the tale ends with a wrap-up
 of the follow-up: the inclusion of the actual Op. 37, comprising 3 excellent sonatas.</p>
