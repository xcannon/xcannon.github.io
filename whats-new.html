<h1>What&rsquo;s New?</h1>
<h3>a vague chronology of events on the site</h3>
<br></div>
<hr>
<h4>2018</h4>
<p><span class="em">April:</span>&nbsp; Big-time retraction of the
 3rd entry of the Stupid Stuff page.&nbsp; Finally researched it as I should
 have, & here I humbly report only that I bought into a very old urban legend.</p>
<p><span class="em">March:</span>&nbsp; Updated my name to Xeno
 in the required places.&nbsp; Decided my original music shall no
 longer be available for theft on the Internet, & edited this page
 accordingly; when it&rsquo;ll be available
 for purchase is yet to be determined.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a tough time
 with computers & their hardware in the past several months, but there may be
 some more Bach forthcoming.</p>
<p>Also, there would appear to be a necessity for an update on the Yahoo player:
 it seems to have stopped working at this point.&nbsp; Stey touned.</p>
<h4>2017</h4>
<p>Nothing happened on this site in 2017.&nbsp; But I sequenced all of
 Bach&rsquo;s English & French Suites, & got the English ones recorded before
 my elderly digital system crapped out.&nbsp; After that, I sequenced Bach&rsquo;s
 <span class="ital">Well-tempered Clavier</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right,
 both books.</p>
<h4>2016</h4>
<p><span class="em">July:</span>&nbsp; The 1st: Uploaded corrected version of
 Handel&rsquo;s Sarabande (Misc.); I missed one (1) note.</p>
<p><span class="em">June:</span>&nbsp; Fixed glitch where 3 of the tunes
 were unavailable.&nbsp; Discovered, made, & posted full version of
 Handel&rsquo;s Sarabande (Misc.).</p>
<p><span class="em">April:</span>&nbsp; Finally got this thing back in working
 order, by putting it up on github.</p>
<p><span class="em">January:</span>&nbsp; 2 new <a
 href="b_reports.html#new">book reports</a>.&nbsp; Oh <span class="ital">yeah!</span></p>
<p>New web host&mdash;a nest of vipers called 5gbfree.com&mdash;deliberately
 breaks site (twice), trying to force the unwary to fork out $$ for support &/or account
 upgrade, to &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; their supposedly free site: pretty much a
 bait-&-switch.&nbsp; Many days of downtime; finally moved it all to a storage
 venue, where it was musically defunct for a few months.&nbsp; 1 of these days
 I will post an incident report, raking those creeps over the coals.&nbsp; Stay
 tuned.</p>
<h4>2015</h4>
<p><span class="em">Late December:</span>&nbsp; Relocation & major additions:
 abandoning Chinese web host; provision of long-labored
 <a href="buxtehude.html">Buxtehude</a> & <a href="kuhnau.html">Kuhnau</a>
 music (Misc.); which, good luck finding <span class="ital">that</span> anywhere
 else.</p>
<p><span class="em">August:</span>&nbsp; <a href="sons_of_bach.html">Sons of
 Bach</a>.</p>
<p><span class="em">July:</span>&nbsp; Decided Dussek&rsquo;s
 <a href="d_sonata_8.html">8th sonata</a> looked lonely; gave it a couple of friends to hang with.</p>
<p><span class="em">June:</span>&nbsp; After laptop breakdown, Mr. CS degree takes a few months to
 figure out how to write pages & FTP on this here newfangled telephone.&nbsp; Added 3 sonatas by Jan
 Dussek & another by Beethoven (his 4th); finally uploaded the last batch o&rsquo; stoopid stuff.</p>
<p><span class="em">February:</span>&nbsp; Added another tune by Sergei to Sergei & Friends (Misc.);
 finally found a lasting solution to the C. Hitchens book link problems; & yes, more stupid stuff.</p>
<p><span class="em">January:</span>&nbsp; Deciphered, sequenced & uploaded Henry Purcell&rsquo;s
 harpsichord suites (Misc.); file count: 428.&nbsp; New <a href="b_reports.html#cd">book
 report</a>; more stupid stuff.</p>
<h4>2014</h4>
<p><span class="em">December:</span>&nbsp; 19 sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti; 3 harp sonatas by
 Sophia Dussek & 1 harp tune by Olivia Buckley, Jan Dussek&rsquo;s wife & daughter.</p>
<p>Also: finally repaired the
 last pop in Beethoven&rsquo;s 21st pt. 3 (start-to-finish the biggest pain-in-the-ass of the
 393 files so far), & added an &lsquo;s&rsquo; to &ldquo;Mussorgky&rdquo; (mp3 tags) on
 the Sergei & Friends (Misc.) album.&nbsp; Additional site tweaks; more stupid stuff.</p><p>Web host begins
 experiencing service interruptions; a year of mounting displeasure commences.</p>
<p><span class="em">November:</span>&nbsp; Added 3 sonatas by Clementi & an album by miscellaneous
 composers; wrote a page called <a
 href="stupid_stuff.html">&ldquo;People Say Some Stupid Stuff&rdquo;</a>.&nbsp; More cosmetic
 adjustments & a few additional links.</p>
<p><span class="em">Early September:</span>&nbsp; The website&rsquo;s 1st birthday:
 Evoe!&nbsp; Added Beethoven&rsquo;s 26th sonata & Dussek&rsquo;s 8th.</p>
<p><span class="em">Late July:</span>&nbsp; A few textual additions, 1 or 2 corrections, minor
 stylesheet changes, & a dozen tiny yet meaningful aesthetic adjustments.</p>
<p><span class="em">Late May:</span>&nbsp; Finally cranked out an improved version of the 3rd movement of
 Beethoven&rsquo;s 21st.</p>
<p><span class="em">Early May:</span>&nbsp; Added Beethoven&rsquo;s 21st sonata.</p>
<p><span class="em">April:</span>&nbsp; Overhaul of music front-end;
 added &ldquo;What&rsquo;s New?&rdquo; page &c.&nbsp; Moved tunes off of Bach & Beethoven
 bio pgs, & fixed Leonore, which had a couple of pops + some distortion at the end.</p>
<p><span class="em">Late March:</span>&nbsp; Added 6 more sonatinas by Clementi, 3
 sonatinas by Beethoven, & an album of Mozart singles; repaired a tiny glitch
 in the 3rd movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s 23rd.&nbsp; Also finally wrote a few <a
 href="b_reports.html">book reports</a>.</p>
<p><span class="em">Early March:</span>&nbsp; Added Beethoven&rsquo;s 23rd sonata.</p>
<p><span class="em">February:</span>&nbsp; Added Beethoven&rsquo;s 14th & 19th sonatas.</p>
<p><span class="em">January:</span>&nbsp; Completed 60 orbits of the Sun.&nbsp; Shortly after that,
 finalized arrangement of Bach singles albums, adding Chaconne in D minor & 2 other trax.</p>
<h4>2013</h4>
<p><span class="em">December:</span>&nbsp; Added 11 Dvo&#345;&aacute;k selections & 83 ragtime
 tunes; answered a few <a href="faaq.html">asinine questions</a>.</p>
<p><span class="em">November:</span>&nbsp; Finally finished Mozart sonatas Vol. 1,
 & later included Mozart themes & variations.</p>
<p><span class="em">September:</span>&nbsp; Website&mdash;with music pages included&mdash;is
 open for biz.&nbsp; Started w/ Bach (nearly everything), Mozart (sonatas Vol. 2)
 & Beethoven (Leonore & 8th sonata), + my own stuff, of course;
 gradually added Clementi, Dussek & Scarlatti.</p>
<p><span class="em">August:</span>&nbsp; Old site&mdash;subdomain chcannon.pixub.com&mdash;is
 created & home page w/ silly portrait uploaded.</p>
<p><span class="em">April:</span>&nbsp; 1st attempt at free music site, which soon fails;
 apparently at x10 &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; meant &ldquo;unlimited up to &#189; a G,
 then actually quite limited&rdquo;.</p>
